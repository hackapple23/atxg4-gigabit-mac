atx adapter for the gigabit power mac g4 


work in progress haven't got any test pcbs
as it says its a adapter to use atx psu's for the gigabit power mac g4 
this was created because i wanted there to be a more easy route than soldering to a 20 to 24 pin adapter 
it's based on the http://atxg4.com feel free to add anything
